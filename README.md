# CalCLI - Command Line Calendar Interface [Features Subject To Change]

Welcome to CalCLI, a command-line tool for managing your calendars and events right from your terminal! This project is a slight variation of a project I am working on as a school project, but now implemented in JavaScript. CalCLI provides a convenient way to interact with Google Calendar without leaving your command line environment.

## Why CalCLI?

While it may seem more intuitive to manage calendars and events through a graphical user interface, CalCLI offers several advantages:

- **Efficiency**: Perform calendar management tasks quickly without switching between applications.
- **Automation**: Integrate calendar management into your scripts and workflows.
- **Customization**: Tailor the functionality of CalCLI to suit your specific needs.

## Features

CalCLI aims to provide comprehensive functionality for managing calendars and events. Here are some of the features I plan to implement:

- **Create Calendar**: Create new calendars to organize your events.
- **Delete Calendar**: Remove unwanted calendars to de-clutter your workspace.
- **Create Event**: Add new events to a specific calendar with customisable details such as title, date, time, and description.
- **Delete Event**: Remove events from a calendar when they are no longer needed.
- **List Calendars**: View a list of all available calendars for quick reference.
- **Display Events**: View upcoming events on a specific calendar.
- **Send Invites**: Invite others to your events by sending email invitations.
